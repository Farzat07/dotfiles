# MPV sockets

A basic script which automates assigning socket files for mpv instances.

The script provides an interface to update the socket filenames, both through
key-bindings and programmatically.

You can set the socket name by providing it as an option:
`--script-opts=socket=<socket name>`
or by pressing ALT+s and entering the new socket name in the mpv window.
